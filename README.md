# Restaurant-Order-Analysis


## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing details of orders placed by customers to restaurants in a food delivery app. The dataset consists of 500 orders placed in a single day. Through data analysis and visualization, we seek to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior, restaurant performance, preferred cuisines, and other relevant insights.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com). It contains information about orders placed by customers, including restaurant details, customer information, order quantities, cuisines, zones, mode of payment, delivery times, etc.

## Tools
- Data Cleaning and Processing: MySQL
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Microsoft Power BI

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
The dataset had undergone data cleaning and preparation using MySQL to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using Microsoft Power BI to explore the dataset and uncover initial insights. This includes visualizing distributions, identifying correlations, and understanding the characteristics of the data. EDA involved exploring the order data to answer the key questions, such as:
1.	Which restaurant received the most orders?
2.	Which customer ordered the most?
3.	When do customers order more in a day?
4.	What is the most liked cuisine?
5.	Which zone has the most sales?
6.	What is the most preferred mode of payment by customers?
7.	Who sells more Pro-category restaurants or ordinary-category restaurants?
8.	How many restaurants are under the Pro and ordinary category?
9.	How much delivery time is taken according to zones?

## Data Analysis
Based on the provided questions, data analysis will be performed to answer each query using appropriate statistical and analytical techniques. This involves querying the dataset, performing calculations, and deriving meaningful insights.

## Results
1. The restaurant "Ellora and The Cave Hotel" received the most orders (32 orders).
2. The customer who ordered the most purchased 7 items.
3. Peak order times are around 11 am to 2 pm.
4. North Indian cuisine is the most liked by customers.
5. Zone D has the highest sales.
6. The mode of payment is evenly distributed among customers.
7. Ordinary-category restaurants sell more than Pro-category restaurants.
8. There are 13 ordinary and 7 pro-category restaurants on the app.
9. Most deliveries are done in Zone D, with delivery times mostly ranging from 15 to 45 minutes.
  
## Recommendations
- Restaurants should focus on offering North Indian cuisine due to its popularity among customers.
- Additional resources may be allocated during peak order times (11 am to 2 pm) to handle increased demand efficiently.
- Further marketing efforts can be directed towards restaurants located in Zone D to capitalize on the high sales volume in that area.

## Limitations
- The analysis is based on a single day's data and may not capture long-term trends accurately.
- Data quality issues such as missing or erroneous data may impact the validity of the findings.
- The results are specific to the dataset and may not be generalizable to other contexts or time periods.

Conclusion:
